# UsersManagerEncrypted plugin for Piwik

Do not use - its development has been discontinued, as explained in https://github.com/piwik/piwik/pull/8781#issuecomment-143309133. Also, it would need Piwik a platform update (which I no longer request) - see https://github.com/Joey3000/piwik-UsersManagerEncrypted/issues/1.
